## The idea

AEMA wanted to update their website. It’s a beautiful landing page that just need better performance and few bug patches. They also want their social media posts on the website.

First, I’ll remake the a proper header. They want it to change when you scroll so I’ll have to use some Javascript.

Then I’ll have to find a library to handle scroll animations.

### APIs

The biggest issue I encountered was the social media APIs. Youtube works fine but LinkedIn always changes. Once in a while they update their API and brake our app.
